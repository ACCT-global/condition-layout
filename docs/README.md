# Condition Layout

The condition layout app allows to conditionally render a block given certain conditions. The app exports two kinds of block: 

- `condition-layout` and extensions - These blocks are responsible for holding your condition blocks.
- `condition` - This blocks hold the condition logic and childrens to be displayed given the condition resolves to true.

## WIP


## Configuration 

In this section, you first must **add the primary instructions** that will allow users to use the block in their store, such as adding the block's app as a dependency in the `manifest.json` and declaring the block itself in a given template.

Next, add the **block's props table**:

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |


Remember to also **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the block in this section, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration.
